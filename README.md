# Framework
Model View View Model (MVVM)
> Model View ViewModel (MVVM) is an architectural pattern applied in applications to separate user interface code from data and business logic. With the clear separation of these components, all components of an app can be unit-tested, components can be reused within the app or across the app, and enhancements to the app can be made without refactoring all the components.
The other architectural patters which separate UI code from data code are MVP and MVC.
